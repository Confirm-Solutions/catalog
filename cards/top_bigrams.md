- `id0`: the first token in the bigram
- `id1`: the most common token following `id0` in The Pile
- `sum_count`: the number of times that `id0` appears in The Pile.
- `max_count`: the number of times that `id1` appears after `id0` in The Pile.
- `frac_max`: `max_count / sum_count`
- `token0`: the string representation of `id0`
- `token1`: the string representation of `id1`
- `seq`: the string representation of the bigram, `token0 token1`
- `p_{model_size}`: the probability of the bigram under Pythia-{model_size} when prompted with `id0`.
